Fragments
--------
We can add the Fragment in 2 ways.
a)Statically adding the Fragment.(Using XML file)
b)Dynamically adding the Fragment.(Using Java code.)


Fragments should not be declared in the manifest file.


Adding a Fragment using a JavaCode.
1)Fragment Tag used in the mainActivity should be removed.
2)We need to use the place holder which can hold the fragment.
Place Holder might be Frame Layout,Linear Layout,Relative Layout any layout.
For simplicity we are using FrameLayout,FrameLayout is designed in such a way that it will block a
particular area on the screen for hosting a particualr widget.
using a FrameLayout is a standard practise.

Fragment Transaction includes these 3 operation.
Add
Replace
Remove

To make a FragmentTransaction Android provides a API called Fragment Transaction.
To get hold of the Fragment Transaction we will be using another API  called Fragment Manager.

Steps are
1)Use an Activity to get hold of the FragmentManager.
2)Using the FragmentManager get hold of the FragmentTransaction.



Note:-
FragmentManager fragmentManager=getFragmentManager();
we cannot use getFragmentManager(); because this API is not supported by the AppCompatActivity in Activity.
AppCompatActivity is provided in mind to support older version of android.

so instead of using getFragmentManager(); we will using FragmentManager fragmentManager=getSupportFragmentManager();
